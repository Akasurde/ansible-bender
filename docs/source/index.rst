   contain the root `toctree` directive.

ansible-bender
==============

Tool which bends containers using Ansible playbooks and turns them into container images. It has a pluggable builder selection â€” it is up to you to pick the tool which will be used to construct your container image. Right now the only supported builder is buildah. More to come in the future. Ansible-bender (ab) relies on Ansible connection plugins for performing builds.
